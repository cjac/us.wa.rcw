         Revised Code of Washington (RCW)         Last Update: April 30, 2015 

   The Revised Code of Washington (RCW) is the compilation of all permanent
   laws now in force. It is a collection of Session Laws (enacted by the
   Legislature, and signed by the Governor, or enacted via the initiative
   process), arranged by topic, with amendments added and repealed laws
   removed. It does not include temporary laws such as appropriations acts.
   The official version of the RCW is published by the Statute Law Committee
   and the Code Reviser.

   The online version of the RCW is updated twice a year, once in the early
   fall following the legislative session, and again at the end of the year
   if a ballot measure that changes the law passed at the general election.
   Copies of the RCW as they existed each year since 2002 are available in
   the RCW Archive.

   The Selected Titles version of the Revised Code of Washington is located
   here.
