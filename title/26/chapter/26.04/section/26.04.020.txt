   RCW 26.04.020                                                        
                                                                        
                          Prohibited marriages.                         

   (1) Marriages in the following cases are prohibited:

        (a) When either party thereto has a spouse or registered domestic
   partner living at the time of such marriage, unless the registered
   domestic partner is the other party to the marriage; or

        (b) When the spouses are nearer of kin to each other than second
   cousins, whether of the whole or half blood computing by the rules of the
   civil law.

        (2) It is unlawful for any person to marry his or her sibling, child,
   grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew.

        (3) A marriage between two persons that is recognized as valid in
   another jurisdiction is valid in this state only if the marriage is not
   prohibited or made unlawful under subsection (1)(a) or (2) of this
   section.

        (4) A legal union, other than a marriage, between two individuals
   that was validly formed in another state or jurisdiction and that provides
   substantially the same rights, benefits, and responsibilities as a
   marriage, does not prohibit those same two individuals from obtaining a
   marriage license in Washington.

        (5) No state agency or local government may base a decision to
   penalize, withhold benefits from, license, or refuse to contract with any
   religious organization based on the opposition to or refusal to provide
   accommodations, facilities, advantages, privileges, service, or goods
   related to the solemnization or celebration of a marriage.

        (6) No religiously affiliated educational institution shall be
   required to provide accommodations, facilities, advantages, privileges,
   service, or goods related to the solemnization or celebration of a
   marriage, including a use of any campus chapel or church. A religiously
   affiliated educational institution shall be immune from a civil claim or
   cause of action, including a claim pursuant to chapter 49.60 RCW, based on
   its refusal to provide accommodations, facilities, advantages, privileges,
   service, or goods related to the solemnization or celebration of a
   marriage under this subsection shall be immune for civil claim or cause of
   action, including a claim pursuant to chapter 49.60 RCW.
